    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <div class="about-phase">
        <h3>Early Life & Childhood Dreams</h3>
        <p>From a very young age, I carried a restless energy â€” an inner voice that always told me I was meant to do something different. While most kids were satisfied following the usual path, I was drawn toward things that set me apart. Singing was my first passion; it gave me the courage to express myself, to perform, and to believe that I had something unique to offer. Those early days were not just about hobbies â€” they were the foundation of my hunger to stand out, to chase passions fearlessly, and to build a life far bigger than ordinary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-phase">
        <h3>Teenage & Fitness Journey</h3>
        <p>During my teenage years, I discovered a new passion â€” fitness and bodybuilding. Hitting the gym every day taught me discipline, patience, and the power of consistent effort. It wasn't just about building muscles; it was about building a mindset that refuses to give up. I learned to push my limits, set goals, and lead by example. This phase shaped my leadership qualities and showed me that real success comes only to those who are ready to work harder than anyone else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-phase">
        <h3>Education Journey</h3>
        <p>My education journey has been as unique as my ambitions. I started at St. Mary's School in Mariampur, Rasra, studying under the ICSE board from Nursery to 8th grade. Later, I moved to Nagaji Saraswati Vidya Mandir for 9th and 10th under the CBSE board. After completing school, I pursued a Diploma in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Industrial Control from Government Polytechnic Gonda (U.P). Each step in my education taught me not just academics, but also perseverance, problem-solving, and the importance of building a strong foundation for my bigger dreams.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-phase">
        <h3>My Entrepreneurship Journey</h3>
        <p>Driven by the dream to build something of my own, I launched my first venture â€” BrightAds, a marketing agency. I invested countless hours learning every aspect of running a business, from strategy to execution. My goal was clear: to make a mark and earn big at a young age. But despite my hard work, securing the necessary funds became a major challenge. That setback didn't stop me; it taught me resilience and grit.</p>
        <p>To gain real-world experience, I then worked as a Sales Executive at Club Next, a garments company. There, I learned the importance of communication, understanding clients, and closing deals. Balancing work and my studies, I continued sharpening my skills, proving that no matter the circumstances, I am ready to hustle, adapt, and grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-phase">
        <h3>Skills & Future Vision</h3>
        <p>Alongside my studies and work, I have constantly focused on building strong technical skills. I have honed my abilities in Excel, Power BI, AutoCAD Electrical, Basic SQL, and Basic PLC. Learning never stops for me â€” every skill adds a new tool to my arsenal for achieving bigger goals. My vision is clear: to create success, earn significantly at a young age, and leave a lasting impact in whatever I do. Every challenge is an opportunity, and I am ready to take them head-on, driven by passion, leadership, and relentless determination.</p>
